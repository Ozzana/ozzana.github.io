<h1>Hello my name is Grga and I am a dog.</h1>
</section>
<p>I am 4 years old and I mostly  sleep in bed of my humans or lie on the couch. They think that they have apartment to themselves, but essentially the place is mine. <br> I mean, where  you hairs are that is what is yours. I love to eat salmon and I have to it for lunch each day (yeah I know livin la vida loca). <br> Moreover, I like long forest walks and chasing and licking rocks. <br> I do love rocks, they are my favourite, you can lick them as much as you want and they never complain. <br> Below you can find list of my favourite things to do: </p> 
<ul>
<li> sleeping</li>
<li> licking my bongo</li>
<li> runing</li>
<li> sleeping</li>
<li>licking my best friend Arya</li>
<li> EATING</li>
<li> getting mad at bycicles, skaters and everything on wheels</li>	
</ul>
